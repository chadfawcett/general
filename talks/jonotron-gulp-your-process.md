Make your life easier by automating the tedious with gulp.js

[Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com) allows you to quickly and easily automate tedious development tasks in
in a programmy kind of way (instead of a configury kind of way). Compile and
minify your css, concat and uglify your javascript, and pipe it all together
into a delicious automated process.
